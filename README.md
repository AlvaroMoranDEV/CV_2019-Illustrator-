# CV / RESUME DESIGN 2019 [ Illustrator ]
CV (resumee) design made using the Adobe Illustrator CC 2018. There is no software development involved in this particular project.

## Motivations

You know its essential to get the attention of the hiring manager of the company you really want to work with. And you a are a worker, right? It doesn't matter what kind of job you do, you know that time (or maybe the lack of it) is your most valuable resource; that's exactly what the hiring manager of any company is also taking into consideration when he/she is reading a ton of resumes looking for that special new employee. So its esential to catch their attention at first glance. 

With this particular project I'll share with you the design on which I've based one of my resumes. 

### Prerequisites

Software that needs to be installed are the following:

```
- Illustrator CC 2018
```
[Free trial version available here](https://www.adobe.com/es/products/illustrator/free-trial-download.html)
You can use other free software such as GIMP or Paint.Net to achieve the same results but for opening this example, illustrator is needed.
